# Controller
The IOT beehive will run on a ESP32 microcontroller platform

## What is it?
ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. 
The ESP32 series employs a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations and includes in-built antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules.

## Sensor array

We're using a variety of diffrent sensors they include but are not limeted to

1) Barrometric sensor

2) Temperature senor

3) Humidity sensor

4) Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) sensor

These sensors will be measured by an BMP680 Sensor 


## Is this for anyone?
Currently it'll require a moderate knowledge of programming and elektronics.


## API

The API is working! It's still running on fossil fuels and is currently beining updated to run on solar!
